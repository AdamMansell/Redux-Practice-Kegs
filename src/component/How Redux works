// Context hook and useState, useReducer hooks:

How Redux works:

- User types an input
- calls an action creator (that returns an action) [actionCreatiors]
- Dispatched to Redux
- Redux inserts that action root reducer [Reducers folder with a root reducer, and some other reducers..]
- root reducer delegates the action to the correct reducer
- reducer is a simple function (pure function) that takes 2 arguments: old state and an action, based on these 2, it returns the
new state
- this new state then stored in the redux store []
- at that point, React knows som state has changed, and it re-renders the DOM
